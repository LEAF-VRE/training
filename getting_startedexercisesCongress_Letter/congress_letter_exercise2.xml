			<opener><salute>To the Honorable Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress Assembled:</salute></opener>
			<p>The undersigned, Citisens of the United States, believing that under the present
					Federal Constitution all women who are citisens of the United States have the
					right to vote, pray your Honorable Body to
				enact a law during the present session that shall assist and protect them in the exercise of t<hi cert="high" rend="underline" xml:space="default"/>hat right.</p>
			<p>And they pray further that they may be permitted in person, and in behalf of the
				thousands of other women who are petitioning Congress to the same effect to be heard
				upon this Memmoiral before the Senate and House at an early day in the present
				Session.</p>
			<p>We ask your Honorable Body to bear in mind that while men are represented on the
				floor of Congress and so may be said to be heard there, women
				who are allowed no vote and therefore no representation cannot truly be heard except
				as Congress shall open its doors to us in person.</p>
