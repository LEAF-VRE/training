            pray your Honorable Body to enact a law during the present session that shall assist and

            Session.</p>
         <p>We ask your Honorable Body to bear in mind that while men are represented on the floor of Congress and so may be said to be heard there, women who are
            allowed no vote and therefore no representation cannot truly be heard except as Congress
            shall open its doors to us in person.</p>
