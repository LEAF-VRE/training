			<head> MACAVITY: THE MYSTERY CAT </head>
			<byline>
				<docAuthor>T.S. Eliot</docAuthor>
			</byline>
			<lg> <l>Macavity's a Mystery Cat: he's called the Hidden Paw</l> <l>For he's the master criminal who can defy the Law.</l> <l>He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's</l> <l>despair:</l><l>For when they reach the scene of crime—Macavity's not there!</l> </lg>
			
			<!-- the stanza above is broken down into line a line group (<lg>) and individual lines (<l>). -->
	
	<p> Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, He's broken every human law, he
				breaks the law of gravity. His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare, And
				when you reach the scene of crime—Macavity's not there! You may seek him in the
				basement, you may look up in the air— But I tell you once and once again, Macavity's
				not there! </p>
			<p> Macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin; You would know him if you saw
				him, for his eyes are sunken in. His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is
				highly domed; His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed. He sways
				his head from side to side, with movements like a snake; And when you think he's
				half asleep, he's always wide awake. </p>

			
			<p> Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, For he's a fiend in feline shape,
				a monster of depravity. You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the
				square-- But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity's not there! </p>

			<p> He's outwardly respectable. (They say he cheats at cards.) And his footprints are
				not found in any file of Scotland Yard's. And when the larder's looted, or the
				jewel-case is rifled, Or when the milk is missing, or another Peke’s been stifled,
				Or the greenhouse glass is broken, and the trellis past repair- Ay, there's the
				wonder of the thing! Macavity's not there! </p>
			<p> And when the Foreign Office find a Treaty's gone astray, Or the Admiralty lose some
				plans and drawings by the way, There may be a scrap of paper in the hall or on the
				stair- But it's useless to investigate—Macavity's not there! And when the loss has
				been disclosed, the Secret Service say: "It must have been Macavityl"—but he's a
				mile away. You'll be sure to find him resting, or a-licking of his thumbs, Or
				engaged in doing complicated long division sums. </p>
			<p> Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a Cat of such
				deceitfulness and suavity. </p>
			<pb n="3" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djakacki/leaf_workshops/main/PracticeMaterials/Section1_ExerciseFiles/Macavity3.jpg"/> 
			
			<p>He always has an alibi, and one or two to spare: At whatever time the deed took
				place-MACAVITY WASN'T / THERE! And they say that all the Cats whose wicked deeds are
				widely known (I might mention Mungojerrie, I might mention Griddlebone) Are nothing
				more than agents for the Cat who all the time Just controls their operations: the
				Napoleon of Crimel </p>
